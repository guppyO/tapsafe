Imagine you’ve just found the perfect apartment. The floor plan is open, the natural light is stunning, and the location is ideal. But as you turn on the kitchen faucet to fill a glass of water, a nagging question crosses your mind: *Is this actually safe to drink?* 

For millions of people living in multi-unit buildings, water quality is often an afterthought—until it becomes a health crisis. Whether it’s lead leaching from old pipes, high levels of PFAS (forever chemicals), or microbial contaminants, the water flowing through your building's infrastructure might not be as pristine as the lobby decor suggests. 

The good news is that you aren't powerless. By leveraging data from the EPA’s Safe Drinking Water Information System (SDWIS), you can transform from a concerned resident into an informed advocate. This guide will show you exactly how to find water quality violations and use that data as a powerful bargaining chip to negotiate for water remediation systems, professional filtration, or even a discount on your monthly rent.

## Understanding the EPA Safe Drinking Water Information System (SDWIS)

Before you can negotiate, you need hard evidence. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) maintains a massive database known as the SDWIS. This system tracks every public water system in the country, documenting whether they are meeting federal safety standards.

When a water utility fails to test for a specific contaminant, fails to report results, or exceeds the Maximum Contaminant Level (MCL) for a dangerous substance, it is flagged as a violation. According to recent statistics, roughly 7% to 10% of the nation's community water systems have at least one health-based violation in any given year. In multi-unit buildings, the stakes are even higher because the building's internal plumbing can exacerbate existing city-wide issues.

To get started, you can [search for your specific area](/search) to see what the local utility’s track record looks like. If the city has a history of violations for lead, copper, or coliform bacteria, there is a high probability that your building’s residents are being exposed.

## Step 1: Identifying Violations in Your Building and Area

The first step in your advocacy journey is gathering your "evidence locker." You want to look for two types of data:

1.  **System-Wide Violations:** These are issues with the municipal water supply providing water to your building. If the city has a history of high nitrates or disinfection byproducts, your landlord is responsible for providing a habitable environment despite these external factors.
2.  **Building-Specific Issues:** While the EPA tracks the utility, multi-unit buildings (especially older ones) often have internal issues like lead service lines or galvanized piping that the city doesn't monitor.

To find this data, start by visiting our [state-by-state water quality directory](/state). Look for the "Consumer Confidence Report" (CCR) for your local utility. If the CCR shows "Action Level Exceedances," you have found your leverage. 

Pay close attention to "Health-Based Violations." These are the most serious and refer to contaminants that can cause immediate or long-term health risks. Documentation of these violations is the "smoking gun" you need when sitting down with a property manager.

## Step 2: Translating Data into Resident Rights

Once you have the data, you need to understand your legal standing. Most lease agreements include an "implied warranty of habitability." This is a legal doctrine that requires landlords to provide a property that is safe and fit for human habitation. 

If the EPA data shows that the water contains levels of lead or arsenic that exceed federal safety limits, the unit may technically be "uninhabitable" under local health codes. 

### Why Landlords Should Care
Landlords are often unaware of the specific EPA violations affecting their properties. When you present this data, you aren't just complaining; you are identifying a liability for them. A building known for poor water quality will see higher turnover, lower property values, and potential legal action. By bringing this to their attention, you are offering them a chance to fix a problem before it devalues their investment.

## Step 3: Negotiating for Water Remediation

If you discover that your building’s water is compromised, your primary goal should be remediation. Remediation means fixing the source of the problem. 

**What to ask for:**
*   **Point-of-Entry (POE) Filtration:** Ask the landlord to install a whole-building filtration system. This treats water as it enters the building, ensuring every faucet provides clean water.
*   **Point-of-Use (POU) Filtration:** If a building-wide system is too expensive, negotiate for high-quality, NSF-certified under-sink filters (like Reverse Osmosis systems) to be installed in every unit.
*   **Pipe Replacement:** If the violation involves lead or copper leaching from internal plumbing, the only permanent fix is replacing the pipes. This is a major ask, but with EPA data in hand, you have the leverage to demand a long-term capital improvement plan.

When you present these requests, bring a printout of the EPA violation report. Say: *"I’ve noticed that our local water system has had three health-based violations for lead in the last 24 months. Since this building was constructed before 1986, I am concerned about our internal plumbing. I’d like to discuss installing a certified filtration system in my unit to ensure the water meets safety standards."*

## Step 4: How to Negotiate a Rent Discount

Sometimes, a landlord won't or can't fix the water quality immediately. In these cases, you are paying full price for a "product" (the apartment) that is defective. This is where the rent discount comes in.

A rent discount serves two purposes: it compensates you for the cost of buying your own bottled water or high-end filters, and it provides a financial incentive for the landlord to eventually fix the problem.

### Calculating the Discount
*   **The Cost of Water:** Calculate the monthly cost of a high-quality water delivery service or the replacement filters for a professional-grade pitcher.
*   **The "Hassle" Factor:** Living in a home where you can't safely brush your teeth or cook with tap water is a significant inconvenience. 
*   **Market Value:** Research if other buildings in the area have "clean water" certifications or filtration systems. If your building lacks these despite known violations, its market value is lower.

A reasonable request is often between 5% and 10% of the monthly rent until the water quality issues are resolved and verified by a third-party test. Use the EPA data to justify this: *"Until the building can prove the water is consistently below the EPA’s Action Levels, the unit does not meet the standards of a premium rental. I am requesting a $150 monthly credit to cover my filtration expenses and the loss of a basic utility."*

## Tips for Success During the Conversation

*   **Be Collaborative, Not Adversarial:** Start by assuming the landlord wants a safe building. Frame your findings as a "safety audit" you performed for your family's health.
*   **Use the Power of Numbers:** If you live in a large complex, talk to your neighbors. A group of ten tenants presenting EPA violation data is much harder to ignore than a single voice.
*   **Get it in Writing:** Any agreement for a rent discount or a promised filtration installation must be added as an addendum to your lease.
*   **Reference "Recent Data":** Always mention that you are looking at the latest statistics from the SDWIS. This shows the landlord that you are staying updated and that the problem is current, not a "legacy" issue from decades ago.

## The Role of Professional Testing

While EPA data tells you what is happening at the city level, a private water test tells you what is happening in your kitchen. If you are serious about negotiating, invest $100–$200 in a lab-certified water test. 

Comparing your home's test results to the EPA's Maximum Contaminant Level Goals (MCLGs) creates an airtight case. If the EPA says the "safe" level for lead is zero (which it is), and your lab test shows 10 parts per billion, you have undeniable proof that your health is at risk.

## Taking Action Today

You don't have to wait for a "boil water" notice to take action. Proactive research is the hallmark of a health-conscious consumer. By understanding the data available to you, you can ensure that your home is a place of wellness rather than a source of environmental exposure.

If you’re a parent, this is about protecting your children’s neurological development. If you’re a renter, this is about getting the value you pay for. If you’re a homeowner, this is about protecting your most significant investment.

## Key Takeaways

*   **Access the SDWIS:** Use the EPA’s database to find health-based violations for your local water utility.
*   **Leverage the "Habitability" Clause:** Use documented violations to argue that your landlord is not providing a safe living environment.
*   **Demand Specific Solutions:** Ask for NSF-certified filtration systems (POE or POU) as a condition of your lease or renewal.
*   **Negotiate Based on Costs:** If remediation isn't immediate, use the cost of independent filtration and the inconvenience of unsafe water to secure a 5-10% rent discount.
*   **Stay Informed:** Regularly check [our about page](/about) to learn more about how we aggregate this data to help you stay safe.
